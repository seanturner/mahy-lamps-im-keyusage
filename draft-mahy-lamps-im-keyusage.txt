 X.509 Certificate Extended Key Usage (EKU) for Instant Messaging URIs
                  draft-mahy-lamps-im-keyusage-latest

Abstract

   RFC 5280 specifies several extended key purpose identifiers
   (KeyPurposeIds) for X.509 certificates.  This document defines
   Instant Messaging (IM) identity KeyPurposeId for inclusion in the
   Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension of X.509 v3 public key
   certificates

1.  Introduction

   Instant Messaging (IM) systems using the Messaging Layer Security
   (MLS) [RFC9420] protocol can incorporate per-client identity
   certificate credentials.  The subjectAltName of these certificates
   can be an IM URI, for example.  Since IM clients could be very
   numerous, operators are reticent to issue certificates for these
   users that might accidentally be used to validate a TLS connection
   because it has the KeyPurposeId id-kp-serverAuth or id-kp-clientAuth.

   An explanation of MLS credentials as they apply to Instant Messaging
   is described in [I-D.barnes-mimi-identity-arch].  These credentials
   are expected to be heavily used in the More Instant Messaging
   Interoperability (MIMI) Working Group.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The IM URI Extended Key Usage

   This specification defines the KeyPurposeId id-kp-imUri, which is
   used for signing messages to prove the identity of an Instant
   Messaging client.  This Extended Key Usage is optionally critical.

   id-kp  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::= {
     iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)
     security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) kp(3) }

   id-kp-imUri OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp TBD }

4.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations of [RFC5280] are applicable to this
   document.  This extended key purpose does not introduce new security
   risks but instead reduces existing security risks by providing means
   to identify if the certificate is generated to sign IM credentials.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the following OIDs in the "SMI Security
   for PKIX Extended Key Purpose" registry (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3).  These
   OIDs are defined in Section 4.

                  +=========+=============+============+
                  | Decimal | Description | References |
                  +=========+=============+============+
                  | TBD1    | id-kp-imUri | This-RFC   |
                  +---------+-------------+------------+

                                 Table 1

   IANA is also requested to register the following ASN.1
   [ITU.X690.2021] module OID in the "SMI Security for PKIX Module
   Identifier" registry (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.0).  This OID is defined in
   Appendix A.

                  +=========+==============+============+
                  | Decimal | Description  | References |
                  +=========+==============+============+
                  | TBD2    | id-kp-im-eku | This-RFC   |
                  +---------+--------------+------------+
